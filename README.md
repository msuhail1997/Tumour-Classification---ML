# Machine Learning for Tumour Classification (PySpark, Sklearn)

### Dataset: Wisconsin (Cancer Diagnostic) dataset

Training and testing were done on Wisconsin (Cancer Diagnostic) dataset for classifying tumours (Benign, Malignant) based on 10 features.

-Hyperparameter tuning, normalization and cross validation were implemented for the 5 ML models created.
