# Classification of Tumours (PySpark, Sklearn)

### Dataset: Breast Cancer Diagnostic Wisconsin

Training and Testing were done on Breast Cancer Diagnostic Wisconsin dataset to obtain classification of tumours to Benign and Malignant based on 10 features.
-Hyperparamaters tuning, Normalization of features and Cross Validation were implemented for the 5 ML models created.
-The following Test,Train accuracies for each of the models were obtained.
